<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">My First Blog</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">First of all, I would like to tell you why I am here. In the world full of fake imaginations and envy, I am here to get some relief from the daily boring routine. It is enough to tell the reason of my such life is that I am an engineering student at IIT Delhi.<br/>Currently, I am at Jaipur, away from the daily world, and writing my first blog. It is not the first time when I am writing something. I used to write on Quora, but it used to be primarily on a particular topic.<br/>What should we write in our very first blog? A lot of people introduce themselves and discuss their daily life routine. Without trying anything different, let's begin.<br/>Hii everyone!!!ðŸ‘‹<br/>I am ManojðŸ˜Š with roots at Kuchaman City, Rajasthan, in western India. I matriculated from ABN sr. Sec. School in 2015 and passed the 12th standard from Navjeevan sr. Sec. School Sikar in 2017. (PS: I am not going to talk about results in my blogs.) In 2018, I cleared JEE advanced and got admission in IIT Delhi with Computer Science and Engineering branch (one of the finest colleges with the delicate department.) With a passion for traveling in different places and making new friends, I am also interested in competitive coding and playing badminton. I am an active member of the NSS IIT Delhi and Indoor sports club IIT Delhi. Currently, I am in 2nd year of my graduation.<br/>This blog is as a dairy to me, and I think it will help to recall old times. I will share my life events and stories of my college life and the nostalgia of my school life. I will also share my experiences of IIT Delhi. In addition to this, if you find many articles on random topics, don't panic.ðŸ˜‰<br/>Regards!</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">A Letter to Papa</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Dear Papa,<br/>Happy father's day papa,<br/>I wanted to talk to you. I mean, as I disappointed you many times in life, So I would like to say you a sorry, and all I want is just a hug for always being with me in every turn of my life. I understand that you have done a lot for me. This is not the single moment of my life, which reminds me of you. Our paths of career are different, but still, whenever I feel discouraged and sad, The only successful face that comes to my mind is you. You are my motivation. The amount of struggle you put for me, for our family is really appreciable. Thanks to this lockdown because of that I spent this much time with you. In Delhi, I missed talking to you, sitting with you. I know I have embarrassed you many times, I have not met your expectations many times, I have made you sad many times. But you always keep holding my hand. Thank you for converting me to be the person I am today.<br/>But I have a complaint about you. That's why I want to have a conversation with you. Why don't you talk? You never tell us anything. Who are you, how are you, the moments you enjoyed in your life, the struggles you faced, you never tell us. Your problems, your sorrows, your moments, your college life, you never tell us anything. You always keep asking us Kya kar rha hai, padhai kr le, ye kr le, wo kr le, aage kya krega etc. etc. Tell us something about yourself also. Today is 21st June, the longest day in the year, summer vacations, and most important father's day. Let's uniquely celebrate this day, just come and sit with us and tell us your stories. Let's build friendship, Papa.  I always wanted a friend like you.<br/><br/>Love you, Papa!!<br/><br/>- Aapka nalayak ladka</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Trusting People Too Easily</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">You are not alone in this strange world who is bearing a syndrome of trusting people so quickly. It is not much distinctive from Stockholm syndrome, except the fact that you don't have any opinion about the other person. It will be your first week in college, and you will meet someone. You will think you are 'vibing' with them because everyone else does too. <br/><br/>This situation occurs when You think You know them but actually, You don't. Sometimes, you just sit down and think, how can you be so stupid? And sometimes be like, dude!!, They are my friend and har ek friend kameena hota hai,  so you shouldn't behave like this.<br/>It can be that best friend who leaked all your secrets to someone else. It can be your friend who made fun of your weaknesses behind your back. The fact is that you were with them whenever they needed you, but there is no return policy. The point is, you trusted them enough to tell them things, which were your weakness, and this bit you in the back.<br/><br/>How did you even think for a moment that they were your friend and not machines or your personal diary whom you trusted blindly? And later, you will realize that "you judge people terribly". You can't do much in this situation except experiencing the harsh reality of this world. You opened the book of your life in front of them.<br/><br/>You think again and again about the mistake you made. You thought everyone has a good heart just because you have. Sooner or later, you will realize that you can't let others walk all over you. Listen to your dad when he says, "don't trust people too easily". You will start living your life with you. And that will be the moment when you will find a new way to live and enjoy your life without being anyone in your life. And maybe, then, everything will be alright.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Open letter to Dipen Kumar</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">I truly believe Man, you will achieve something big one day. I am glad to have a friend like you. I never dream of having a so good friend in my life, who is ready to help anytime, anywhere and for anything.<br/><br/>What I achieved here at college is "A few Friends",  ?? right a few!<br/>I have interacted with many, really a many but with only a few, I am able to make bond, a bond forever. I never dream of having a so close friend, so humble friend. He still have childhood left in him but that's truly a sign of purity, pure heart, pure smile and that's what I love the most in him.<br/>I always have a perception that the guys coming from hostels, big institutes are very clever and cannot be trusted soon (Manoj be like Papa ki sunkar aaya h shayad). All my opinions are vain when I met you.<br/><br/>I never thought I would write this so suddenly. When I was pressing b with my keyboard in a google search to search brusque meaning, google suggested beMotivated website (since I have history of searching) and in all haste, I pressed enter. I reached here, read some posts by Manoj and then my mind makes up soon to post something and I chose you, my friend.<br/>You really is a man with true motivation and that's what you did.(lol)</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Learn To Say No</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Yes!!<br/>Saying 'no' is not that bad. We have always been taught to help someone and not move back because they think you can help them, and that's the biggest compliment anyone can offer to you. We should always be grateful to them. I always obeyed this and kept saying 'yes'.<br/><br/>But excess of everything is terrible. Everything in excess is opposed to nature. You feel happy by seeing their grateful faces whenever you help them. But doesn't it mean that you are making them habituated to not work on their own? YES!! Sometimes it does.<br/><br/>The thing about being the person who can't say 'no' is that you are no longer doing someone a favor. They will push it on you like it's your job. And when you say 'no' the first time, you will suddenly feel like you become the bad guy. The fear of losing your friend will stick on your mind, and that will always force you to keep saying 'yes'.<br/><br/>Now I am learning to say 'no', and I am liking the person I am becoming. After this long vacation, I will be a different person whose 'nos' doesn't get stuck in his mouth. I am learning not to let people dominate over me. After this, I know people will be rude towards me; they will show that I am doing which I shouldn't do. But in 5-6 days, everything will be under control. I will begin to prioritize myself. After this, no one will be able to take control of my own. I will be the real 'ME'.<br/><br/>Say 'no' to the ones who are unkind, rude, and selfish. Say 'no' to those who are not grateful and trying to walk over you. If they text me that they "need to talk!". Bro!! I am not a therapist. Surely we will talk but not at the cost of my own mental health. I will be there for you only if when I know that you can be there for me, too.<br/><br/>This type of little changes will make your life your own. You will be able to enjoy your life in your way. You will find your true companions. And that will be the moment when you will realize the difference between fake and faithful friendship and also the bitter truth of life.<br/><br/>Manoj Kumar<br/>dayonhorizon.blogspot.com</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Dear Berlin From Money Heist</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Dear Berlin,<br/>In the beginning, I never thought of putting the "Dear" in front of your name. But you earned it by presenting yourself weaponless in front of the snipers.  <br/>I uncovered a lot of things from you. No other in-charge can substitute you in any heist. The way you tackled all the worse situations is much appreciable. I am in love with your leadership qualities. The moment when Tokyo played Russian Roulette, even your haters will appreciate your courage. Your dialogues, your way of saying, your leadership qualities and your friendship with the Professor stand outstanding.<br/><br/>"We are all going to die. And I drink to that because we are still alive, Here's to life." Your perspective towards your life is the one that should be everyone's perspective in a peaceful world. Even after knowing that you will be dead in the next 3 years, you went for the heist proves your own sentence to the Professor, "If a painter told you he had three years left to alive, would you tell him to stop painting." It shows your enchantment with your work.<br/>After all, love is a good reason to make everything go wrong. Why did you fall in love with her?? Why did you believe in her?? You were a complex character, yet you made us root for you when you said, "love can't be timed, it has to be lived." You loved and broke-up 5 times, and at the difficult times in the heist, you again let yourself find your 6th love Ariadana only to be betrayed by her.<br/>While you mesmerized us with your smile, the way of looking by your eyes and your wise words such as "First times are so special. Unique. But the last times are beyond comparison. They are priceless. But people don't normally know it's their last time".<br/><br/>You might be AndrÃ©s de Fonollosa, but to us, you will always be Berlin. You had spent all your life being a bit of a son of a bitch, but Yes, you died with dignity.<br/><br/>Love, <br/><br/>A Fan,<br/>Manoj<br/>dayonhorizon.blogspot.com</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">That Introvert Guy</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">College life begins. The very first day of college, shyness, and hesitation all around. He came in this world without watching all web series (Will this society accept him?). He listens to his friends discussing Game of Thrones, Friends, Money Heist, Big Bang theory, etc. etc. That's the time when the first stage of appearing FOMO. Bro! If you didn't watch Money Heist, you have seen nothing. He doesn't want to spend his 4 years of his college with this Fear of Missing Out. At this moment, an introvert person will always blame to being introverted. But soon, he realizes that it is not that bad. Even the fear of missing out departs from his life within 4-5 months. But he got to know the behavior of the world. An introvert person always thinks to be extrovert because he assumes that extrovert guys are the extraordinarily happy people on the earth.<br/><br/>You call him an introvert but, I call him a person with exceptional patience in listening to others like his own. He talks so little but so pure that you won't find anything concrete in that at first, but everything he says means a lot. Such a person has excellent observation skills. If he falls in love with you, he will use his observation skills on you. For him, observation is everything he listens to your words, watches your facial expressions, and talks to you only those things you like. Love for him is a responsibility. To fall in love with you is a gift he doesn't need, but he definitely desires. He falls for you for no reason, he likes you despite your faults. He leaves his comfort zone.<br/><br/>Shyness and introversion are two different things. Always keep in mind that an introvert person need not be necessarily shy. "I wanted to be someone else", often said by an introvert person. He always thinks it has to be cool to have that infectious energy that draws people around him. As a guy, he thinks this is the only way to get the ladies (although it isn't). Sometimes it's hard to explain to other people how it actually feels to be an introvert. For him, "Why don't you want to go to this party?" is sometimes difficult to answer. It's not like he doesn't enjoy having fun. He just wants to do it around the right people. He really does like other people; he is not anti-social. Be patient with him. After spending some time with him, you will find a trustworthy person with a deeper meaning and high introspectiveness who believes in "real" friendship.<br/><br/>-Manoj<br/>dayonhorizon.blogspot.com</p>

So, I must have done something for him?<br/>True, I found this network and then opened website and thought again to post something that wasn't expected out of me, but now that I did.<br/>We all have memories to think and wonder upon, some bitter, some sour and some sweet.

<p style="font-size:20px">After a long week, your exams are over. You're mindlessly scrolling your insta feed, and suddenly, you stop. You see a post of someone who was once really, really close to you. Now you start to scroll your memories with that person, but you realize that you have just grown apart.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You remember how you used to do all bakchodis together. You just laugh at it and keep scrolling your memories. That one song always sticks with that person, and you are about to fall into nostalgia.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But suddenly, this nostalgia turns into a sense of sadness. Try to remember the last time you saw them? How they used to sound? The last time when were you guys talked normally? There might be some incidents that separated both of you. But wait! you still remember some silly jokes on which you both used to laugh. A slight wave of thoughts comes into your mind saying how much you both knew about each other. Your dreams, your embarrassing moments, your crushes, everything suddenly starts roaming around you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Did you ever think about a day when you both weren't together? Did you ever think of a day when you would live a life without them? Well! Time changes, and with time, everything changes. But deep down, aren't you still eager to just meet them and hug them tightly and relive your childhood? This tiny smile on your face with your filled eyes tells everything.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And you realize these are some lost friendships that can never be the same again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Manoj<br/>(https://dayonhorizon.blogspot.com/)</p>
