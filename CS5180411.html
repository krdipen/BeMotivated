<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">My First Blog</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">First of all, I would like to tell you why I am here. In the world full of fake imaginations and envy, I am here to get some relief from the daily boring routine. It is enough to tell the reason of my such life is that I am an engineering student at IIT Delhi.<br/>Currently, I am at Jaipur, away from the daily world, and writing my first blog. It is not the first time when I am writing something. I used to write on Quora, but it used to be primarily on a particular topic.<br/>What should we write in our very first blog? A lot of people introduce themselves and discuss their daily life routine. Without trying anything different, let's begin.<br/>Hii everyone!!!ðŸ‘‹<br/>I am ManojðŸ˜Š with roots at Kuchaman City, Rajasthan, in western India. I matriculated from ABN sr. Sec. School in 2015 and passed the 12th standard from Navjeevan sr. Sec. School Sikar in 2017. (PS: I am not going to talk about results in my blogs.) In 2018, I cleared JEE advanced and got admission in IIT Delhi with Computer Science and Engineering branch (one of the finest colleges with the delicate department.) With a passion for traveling in different places and making new friends, I am also interested in competitive coding and playing badminton. I am an active member of the NSS IIT Delhi and Indoor sports club IIT Delhi. Currently, I am in 2nd year of my graduation.<br/>This blog is as a dairy to me, and I think it will help to recall old times. I will share my life events and stories of my college life and the nostalgia of my school life. I will also share my experiences of IIT Delhi. In addition to this, if you find many articles on random topics, don't panic.ðŸ˜‰<br/>Regards!</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">A Letter to Papa</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Dear Papa,<br/>Happy father's day papa,<br/>I wanted to talk to you. I mean, as I disappointed you many times in life, So I would like to say you a sorry, and all I want is just a hug for always being with me in every turn of my life. I understand that you have done a lot for me. This is not the single moment of my life, which reminds me of you. Our paths of career are different, but still, whenever I feel discouraged and sad, The only successful face that comes to my mind is you. You are my motivation. The amount of struggle you put for me, for our family is really appreciable. Thanks to this lockdown because of that I spent this much time with you. In Delhi, I missed talking to you, sitting with you. I know I have embarrassed you many times, I have not met your expectations many times, I have made you sad many times. But you always keep holding my hand. Thank you for converting me to be the person I am today.<br/>But I have a complaint about you. That's why I want to have a conversation with you. Why don't you talk? You never tell us anything. Who are you, how are you, the moments you enjoyed in your life, the struggles you faced, you never tell us. Your problems, your sorrows, your moments, your college life, you never tell us anything. You always keep asking us Kya kar rha hai, padhai kr le, ye kr le, wo kr le, aage kya krega etc. etc. Tell us something about yourself also. Today is 21st June, the longest day in the year, summer vacations, and most important father's day. Let's uniquely celebrate this day, just come and sit with us and tell us your stories. Let's build friendship, Papa.  I always wanted a friend like you.<br/><br/>Love you, Papa!!<br/><br/>- Aapka nalayak ladka</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Trusting People Too Easily</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">You are not alone in this strange world who is bearing a syndrome of trusting people so quickly. It is not much distinctive from Stockholm syndrome, except the fact that you don't have any opinion about the other person. It will be your first week in college, and you will meet someone. You will think you are 'vibing' with them because everyone else does too. <br/><br/>This situation occurs when You think You know them but actually, You don't. Sometimes, you just sit down and think, how can you be so stupid? And sometimes be like, dude!!, They are my friend and har ek friend kameena hota hai,  so you shouldn't behave like this.<br/>It can be that best friend who leaked all your secrets to someone else. It can be your friend who made fun of your weaknesses behind your back. The fact is that you were with them whenever they needed you, but there is no return policy. The point is, you trusted them enough to tell them things, which were your weakness, and this bit you in the back.<br/><br/>How did you even think for a moment that they were your friend and not machines or your personal diary whom you trusted blindly? And later, you will realize that "you judge people terribly". You can't do much in this situation except experiencing the harsh reality of this world. You opened the book of your life in front of them.<br/><br/>You think again and again about the mistake you made. You thought everyone has a good heart just because you have. Sooner or later, you will realize that you can't let others walk all over you. Listen to your dad when he says, "don't trust people too easily". You will start living your life with you. And that will be the moment when you will find a new way to live and enjoy your life without being anyone in your life. And maybe, then, everything will be alright.</p>
