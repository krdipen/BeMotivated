<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Get into your deep thoughts</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Guys, we all know that it is one of the most terrible disaster happening to human civilisation. Although all of us are sacrificing and fighting with this virus, we do not know how many of us are going to win the battle and how many of us are going to fall behind.<br/>We are given enough time in this lockdown perhaps the longest time after we entered the college life, and perhaps is going to be our last such holiday. There are many unusual happenings going all around us. Though we always encourage to hope for a better tomorrow but no of is aware of what is going to happen tomorrow.<br/>Guys, stay at home and take all the necessary precautions. Take care of yourself and your family. Whenever you get time talk to you parents, tell them about your plans, talk to your brother/sister, spend some time interacting with them. We should utilise the resources we are provided with. I have seen people spending hours and hours on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, scrolling the posts/videos, but when they are asked for the assignments/online lecture, they simply raise their hands telling, "Sorry, I don't have an internet connection!". <br/>Stay at home, stay happy.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px">This goes for DIWAKAR.<br/>It is not about raising hand and spending hours on social media or scrolling meme/post but what actually matter is this pandemic creates pressure, not a blood neither a physical pressure. You know i am talking about PRESSURE ON. MIND so i think somehow it's normal people scrolling post because somewhat it's help in getting fresh and at least we laugh. We already tired thinking about future, thinking about how would college do , are they going to take exam or not??. .<br/>.<br/>So i guess it's ok if people are happy by scrolling post, talking to somebody hours nd hours. <br/>So just be Happy that's the most important thing and #besafe</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Learn To Say No</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Yes!!<br/>Saying 'no' is not that bad. We have always been taught to help someone and not move back because they think you can help them, and that's the biggest compliment anyone can offer to you. We should always be grateful to them. I always obeyed this and kept saying 'yes'.<br/><br/>But excess of everything is terrible. Everything in excess is opposed to nature. You feel happy by seeing their grateful faces whenever you help them. But doesn't it mean that you are making them habituated to not work on their own? YES!! Sometimes it does.<br/><br/>The thing about being the person who can't say 'no' is that you are no longer doing someone a favor. They will push it on you like it's your job. And when you say 'no' the first time, you will suddenly feel like you become the bad guy. The fear of losing your friend will stick on your mind, and that will always force you to keep saying 'yes'.<br/><br/>Now I am learning to say 'no', and I am liking the person I am becoming. After this long vacation, I will be a different person whose 'nos' doesn't get stuck in his mouth. I am learning not to let people dominate over me. After this, I know people will be rude towards me; they will show that I am doing which I shouldn't do. But in 5-6 days, everything will be under control. I will begin to prioritize myself. After this, no one will be able to take control of my own. I will be the real 'ME'.<br/><br/>Say 'no' to the ones who are unkind, rude, and selfish. Say 'no' to those who are not grateful and trying to walk over you. If they text me that they "need to talk!". Bro!! I am not a therapist. Surely we will talk but not at the cost of my own mental health. I will be there for you only if when I know that you can be there for me, too.<br/><br/>This type of little changes will make your life your own. You will be able to enjoy your life in your way. You will find your true companions. And that will be the moment when you will realize the difference between fake and faithful friendship and also the bitter truth of life.<br/><br/>Manoj Kumar<br/>dayonhorizon.blogspot.com</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Dear Berlin From Money Heist</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Dear Berlin,<br/>In the beginning, I never thought of putting the "Dear" in front of your name. But you earned it by presenting yourself weaponless in front of the snipers.  <br/>I uncovered a lot of things from you. No other in-charge can substitute you in any heist. The way you tackled all the worse situations is much appreciable. I am in love with your leadership qualities. The moment when Tokyo played Russian Roulette, even your haters will appreciate your courage. Your dialogues, your way of saying, your leadership qualities and your friendship with the Professor stand outstanding.<br/><br/>"We are all going to die. And I drink to that because we are still alive, Here's to life." Your perspective towards your life is the one that should be everyone's perspective in a peaceful world. Even after knowing that you will be dead in the next 3 years, you went for the heist proves your own sentence to the Professor, "If a painter told you he had three years left to alive, would you tell him to stop painting." It shows your enchantment with your work.<br/>After all, love is a good reason to make everything go wrong. Why did you fall in love with her?? Why did you believe in her?? You were a complex character, yet you made us root for you when you said, "love can't be timed, it has to be lived." You loved and broke-up 5 times, and at the difficult times in the heist, you again let yourself find your 6th love Ariadana only to be betrayed by her.<br/>While you mesmerized us with your smile, the way of looking by your eyes and your wise words such as "First times are so special. Unique. But the last times are beyond comparison. They are priceless. But people don't normally know it's their last time".<br/><br/>You might be Andrés de Fonollosa, but to us, you will always be Berlin. You had spent all your life being a bit of a son of a bitch, but Yes, you died with dignity.<br/><br/>Love, <br/><br/>A Fan,<br/>Manoj<br/>dayonhorizon.blogspot.com</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">That Introvert Guy</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">College life begins. The very first day of college, shyness, and hesitation all around. He came in this world without watching all web series (Will this society accept him?). He listens to his friends discussing Game of Thrones, Friends, Money Heist, Big Bang theory, etc. etc. That's the time when the first stage of appearing FOMO. Bro! If you didn't watch Money Heist, you have seen nothing. He doesn't want to spend his 4 years of his college with this Fear of Missing Out. At this moment, an introvert person will always blame to being introverted. But soon, he realizes that it is not that bad. Even the fear of missing out departs from his life within 4-5 months. But he got to know the behavior of the world. An introvert person always thinks to be extrovert because he assumes that extrovert guys are the extraordinarily happy people on the earth.<br/><br/>You call him an introvert but, I call him a person with exceptional patience in listening to others like his own. He talks so little but so pure that you won't find anything concrete in that at first, but everything he says means a lot. Such a person has excellent observation skills. If he falls in love with you, he will use his observation skills on you. For him, observation is everything he listens to your words, watches your facial expressions, and talks to you only those things you like. Love for him is a responsibility. To fall in love with you is a gift he doesn't need, but he definitely desires. He falls for you for no reason, he likes you despite your faults. He leaves his comfort zone.<br/><br/>Shyness and introversion are two different things. Always keep in mind that an introvert person need not be necessarily shy. "I wanted to be someone else", often said by an introvert person. He always thinks it has to be cool to have that infectious energy that draws people around him. As a guy, he thinks this is the only way to get the ladies (although it isn't). Sometimes it's hard to explain to other people how it actually feels to be an introvert. For him, "Why don't you want to go to this party?" is sometimes difficult to answer. It's not like he doesn't enjoy having fun. He just wants to do it around the right people. He really does like other people; he is not anti-social. Be patient with him. After spending some time with him, you will find a trustworthy person with a deeper meaning and high introspectiveness who believes in "real" friendship.<br/><br/>-Manoj<br/>dayonhorizon.blogspot.com</p>

<p style="font-size:20px">After a long week, your exams are over. You're mindlessly scrolling your insta feed, and suddenly, you stop. You see a post of someone who was once really, really close to you. Now you start to scroll your memories with that person, but you realize that you have just grown apart.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You remember how you used to do all bakchodis together. You just laugh at it and keep scrolling your memories. That one song always sticks with that person, and you are about to fall into nostalgia.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But suddenly, this nostalgia turns into a sense of sadness. Try to remember the last time you saw them? How they used to sound? The last time when were you guys talked normally? There might be some incidents that separated both of you. But wait! you still remember some silly jokes on which you both used to laugh. A slight wave of thoughts comes into your mind saying how much you both knew about each other. Your dreams, your embarrassing moments, your crushes, everything suddenly starts roaming around you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Did you ever think about a day when you both weren't together? Did you ever think of a day when you would live a life without them? Well! Time changes, and with time, everything changes. But deep down, aren't you still eager to just meet them and hug them tightly and relive your childhood? This tiny smile on your face with your filled eyes tells everything.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And you realize these are some lost friendships that can never be the same again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Manoj<br/>(https://dayonhorizon.blogspot.com/)</p>
