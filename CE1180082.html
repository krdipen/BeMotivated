<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Story of Racism, Elitism and Classism</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px"># I can't breadth<br/><br/>Motivation: <br/>The history here is to reveal that we should left the rat race and break the chain of racism, elitism and classism.<br/><br/>Recent Incident:<br/>George Floyd, an old black man lost his life when a white police man knelt on Floyd's neck for around nine minutes. He beg for his life and died repeatedly saying "I can't breadth".<br/><br/>What strikes the mind?<br/>Going down memory lane, I am forced to ponder on the famous words of the great human right activist, Martin Luther King Jr.; the need to throw more light on this saying has made it binding on me to elucidate explicitly the true intentions and sincere motives of the late icon when he said; “Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere”.<br/><br/>Looking at the world:<br/>USA:<br/>The incident of Racism and white supremacy against George Floyd. Blacks are treated differently in U.S.<br/>Europe:<br/>How Neo-Nazis were prosecuted on the basis of religion, minority and refugee status.<br/>China:<br/>The voice of Dr. Li Wenliang who pointed out Corona outbreak was suppressed. Now, finally she was diagnosed with covid19. The voice of dissent is also a form of discrimination.<br/>India:<br/>1. Caste: How Dalits and manual scavengers are treated by upper caste, although untouchability is prohibited by Indian constitution.<br/>2. Communal: How police treats the north eastern states people in case of a suspect.<br/>3. Regional: How south Indians are treated in U.P., Bihar. How poor class of U.P., Bihar are treated in Maharashtra.<br/><br/>#The battle to discrimination is way far.<br/>You must have remembered Nelson Mandela, M.K. Gandhi, Martin Luther King. The fights of these leaders are still not come to an end. Although much has been changed legally and constitutionally but the ground reality is still the same.<br/>The intention was not to deliberate and point out flaws in system but to show that only us, the citizen, the human can only change this.<br/><br/>#F4T<br/>If humans are treated this way, then how we treat animals? There are a number of incident showing man-animal conflict.<br/>Anything strikes in your mind? (Elephant in Karnataka)<br/><br/>We must come together and spread this message in a positive tone.<br/>Remember: #Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere<br/><br/>The next victim can be you, who knows.</p>
