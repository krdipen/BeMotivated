<p style="font-size:20px">Hi! I am Dipen, Welcome to BeMotivated Network. This is a blogging network closed to the IIT Delhi community. It is owned and operated by BeMotivated Group. It was created for learning purposes. Learning is not limited to lecture halls. Sometimes, it becomes too tense and gives us nothing more than stress. This is my first practical, real-world computer-science fun creation, which was a great learning experience. BeMotivated Network aims to provide every IITD student a platform to express themselves through their stories, memes, or any other content.

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Story of Racism, Elitism and Classism</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px"># I can't breadth<br/><br/>Motivation: <br/>The history here is to reveal that we should left the rat race and break the chain of racism, elitism and classism.<br/><br/>Recent Incident:<br/>George Floyd, an old black man lost his life when a white police man knelt on Floyd's neck for around nine minutes. He beg for his life and died repeatedly saying "I can't breadth".<br/><br/>What strikes the mind?<br/>Going down memory lane, I am forced to ponder on the famous words of the great human right activist, Martin Luther King Jr.; the need to throw more light on this saying has made it binding on me to elucidate explicitly the true intentions and sincere motives of the late icon when he said; ‚ÄúInjustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere‚Äù.<br/><br/>Looking at the world:<br/>USA:<br/>The incident of Racism and white supremacy against George Floyd. Blacks are treated differently in U.S.<br/>Europe:<br/>How Neo-Nazis were prosecuted on the basis of religion, minority and refugee status.<br/>China:<br/>The voice of Dr. Li Wenliang who pointed out Corona outbreak was suppressed. Now, finally she was diagnosed with covid19. The voice of dissent is also a form of discrimination.<br/>India:<br/>1. Caste: How Dalits and manual scavengers are treated by upper caste, although untouchability is prohibited by Indian constitution.<br/>2. Communal: How police treats the north eastern states people in case of a suspect.<br/>3. Regional: How south Indians are treated in U.P., Bihar. How poor class of U.P., Bihar are treated in Maharashtra.<br/><br/>#The battle to discrimination is way far.<br/>You must have remembered Nelson Mandela, M.K. Gandhi, Martin Luther King. The fights of these leaders are still not come to an end. Although much has been changed legally and constitutionally but the ground reality is still the same.<br/>The intention was not to deliberate and point out flaws in system but to show that only us, the citizen, the human can only change this.<br/><br/>#F4T<br/>If humans are treated this way, then how we treat animals? There are a number of incident showing man-animal conflict.<br/>Anything strikes in your mind? (Elephant in Karnataka)<br/><br/>We must come together and spread this message in a positive tone.<br/>Remember: #Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere<br/><br/>The next victim can be you, who knows.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">My First Blog</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">First of all, I would like to tell you why I am here. In the world full of fake imaginations and envy, I am here to get some relief from the daily boring routine. It is enough to tell the reason of my such life is that I am an engineering student at IIT Delhi.<br/>Currently, I am at Jaipur, away from the daily world, and writing my first blog. It is not the first time when I am writing something. I used to write on Quora, but it used to be primarily on a particular topic.<br/>What should we write in our very first blog? A lot of people introduce themselves and discuss their daily life routine. Without trying anything different, let's begin.<br/>Hii everyone!!!üëã<br/>I am Manojüòä with roots at Kuchaman City, Rajasthan, in western India. I matriculated from ABN sr. Sec. School in 2015 and passed the 12th standard from Navjeevan sr. Sec. School Sikar in 2017. (PS: I am not going to talk about results in my blogs.) In 2018, I cleared JEE advanced and got admission in IIT Delhi with Computer Science and Engineering branch (one of the finest colleges with the delicate department.) With a passion for traveling in different places and making new friends, I am also interested in competitive coding and playing badminton. I am an active member of the NSS IIT Delhi and Indoor sports club IIT Delhi. Currently, I am in 2nd year of my graduation.<br/>This blog is as a dairy to me, and I think it will help to recall old times. I will share my life events and stories of my college life and the nostalgia of my school life. I will also share my experiences of IIT Delhi. In addition to this, if you find many articles on random topics, don't panic.üòâ<br/>Regards!</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">A Letter to Papa</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Dear Papa,<br/>Happy father's day papa,<br/>I wanted to talk to you. I mean, as I disappointed you many times in life, So I would like to say you a sorry, and all I want is just a hug for always being with me in every turn of my life. I understand that you have done a lot for me. This is not the single moment of my life, which reminds me of you. Our paths of career are different, but still, whenever I feel discouraged and sad, The only successful face that comes to my mind is you. You are my motivation. The amount of struggle you put for me, for our family is really appreciable. Thanks to this lockdown because of that I spent this much time with you. In Delhi, I missed talking to you, sitting with you. I know I have embarrassed you many times, I have not met your expectations many times, I have made you sad many times. But you always keep holding my hand. Thank you for converting me to be the person I am today.<br/>But I have a complaint about you. That's why I want to have a conversation with you. Why don't you talk? You never tell us anything. Who are you, how are you, the moments you enjoyed in your life, the struggles you faced, you never tell us. Your problems, your sorrows, your moments, your college life, you never tell us anything. You always keep asking us Kya kar rha hai, padhai kr le, ye kr le, wo kr le, aage kya krega etc. etc. Tell us something about yourself also. Today is 21st June, the longest day in the year, summer vacations, and most important father's day. Let's uniquely celebrate this day, just come and sit with us and tell us your stories. Let's build friendship, Papa.  I always wanted a friend like you.<br/><br/>Love you, Papa!!<br/><br/>- Aapka nalayak ladka</p>
