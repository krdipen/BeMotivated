Things are different in real life and are manipulated in a way to entertain people.<br/><br/>Special thanks to Akhil Bajiya, PM Modi, Andrew Ng, Chitti, RopeClimber, Robotics IITD, Tinder, FaceApp<br/><br/>It has been a while since Akhil is on Tinder. Being his roommate, I can feel his struggle.<br/><br/>Hi, I am Dipen Kumar from #BeMotivated, and I am back again with another inspiring story from NC6 Shivalik IITD. Today I am going to talk about a dreamer, a believer, an achiever. Yes, you got me. He is Akhil. Back to his struggling days, he was just another guy, just like you and me, if you have a girlfriend exclude yourself. It was not easy. Those days were tough but not tough enough to stop the fire within him. It only grew bigger and bigger. His ambition pulled him, and he never stopped. With no instant result, with several public criticisms, with no one to support, there was also an idea of success that he has visualized. Now he wanted to taste it. He wanted to live it.<br/><br/>Nothing can stop a person unless he/she wants to stop. Now whom you see is not Akhil. He has his story; he has his experience; he has his learning with him. He is a hero—a hero of his life, a hero of his girl. Yes, Akhil is no more single, gone are those days of struggle. His quest for his love met his fate. He worked for it; he lived for it; he prayed for it.<br/><br/>The last day of the last month was the day when he last opened his Tinder, and guess what? He found his match. #MadeForEachOther. Off-course no, This is never going to happen regardless of his effort.<br/><br/>PM Modi was an eye-opener for him. He realized that his dream should not be dependent on any app or any other person. #Atmanirbhar. But he can depend on his roommate for alarm. Back to the point, Akhil had led a team on project #RopeClimber although he was busy in his volleyball practice to attend meetings. His experience with robotics has strengthened his mechanical and electrical domain, and now, thanks to Andrew Ng, he can include Machine Learning in his work. The result is a smart, intelligent, gorgeous, beautiful-looking, self-made AI- Chinti, speed 2 Terabyte, and memory 2 Zettabyte. #MakeForYourself<br/><br/>Akhil is a youth icon for many and an inspiration to all.</p>

BeMotivated Lockdown Series presents you with another overwhelming story. This is a story of you, me, and everyone who has an attachment to something or someone. This girl has a message from 2070 for her grandfather. This is Zanskar IITD, and not hard to guess she is Mehtab's granddaughter. Unfortunately, the whole nation is locked down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She is worried as she needs to give this message to her grandfather. She has come back to 2020, and we won't let her effort go waste. Thanks to BeMotivated network, she has hope. We are the voice of every Indian.<br/><br/>This is a message from Mehtab 2070 to Mehtab 2020 via his granddaughter, who has traveled time. The message goes this way- "Hi Mehtab, I am you from future. Do you know who this girl is? Look at her eyes. Don't you feel any connection? She is your granddaughter. She is just like you, except she is more active than you. Instead of sitting in her room and waste the entire day playing PUBG, she prefers to work and engage in meaningful activities. And you won't believe she regularly attends her lectures and doesn't smoke weed. Give your head some break over your crush on Kannada beauty Rashmika Mandanna. Living daydreaming, and ignoring one's well being is not healthy. Spend some time with your granddaughter, and she will make some positive changes in you. In response, it's your job to teach her discipline. You don't need to do much, just get her enrolled in COL106 and make sure prof. Subodh Kumar is taking the course.<br/><br/>CHAPTER 2 - SAD NEWS<br/><br/>I want you to take a seat and have a glass of water. Hold on tight and be strong. I have some sad news to tell you. I am sorry. PUBG will not exist in future. It will be a hard time for you. Things will not be the same. But Mehtab, life continues. Life is beautiful, and what makes it beautiful is love. You must be thinking what if when life is without love, without PUBG. So listen Mehtab, this is a wise old man speaking- Love is the state of mind when you choose to be happy, and it is blocked by grief. Lay down all your grief in front of you. Release all your sadness. Love is a form of energy that swirls all around us. Your love for PUBG will not leave this world. It will remain in your heart. Don't let your sadness suppress those good memories you had with PUBG.<br/><br/>Remember those days when professors used to bully you, your crush dating Rakshit Shetty, you struggling with assignments to meet deadlines. Wasn't that enough for you to leave this shitty world? But you didn't give up. You stayed strong. Answer me, Mehtab, what kept you so strong. It was your love for PUBG that kept you attached to this world. You have an amazing history and memorable moments with PUBG. I remember the day when you first installed PUBG on your phone. You started to enjoy playing it and developed a strong bond for it. In your initial days, you struggled to run it on your old Android phone. But that could not stop you. You bought a brand new, heavy-duty gaming phone. The struggle was not yet over. Poor internet connectivity is something that was, that is, and that will be in between you and PUBG long as you both are together.<br/><br/>CHAPTER 3 - PUBG WAR<br/><br/>PUBG was gaining popularity worldwide. And one day, it occurred to the mind of the supreme leader of North Korea to try it. He didn't survive even a minute in the game. After several repeated failed attempts, he was out of his line. He then used his military. Soon North Korean soldiers, instead of attending their Korean border, were seen everywhere in PUBG. They were killing players to make the game a cakewalk for their supreme leader. As a result, many countries decided to join PUBG with their defense forces to protect their players. And when the United States joined PUBG for the fight against the Korean military, China allied with North Korea to claim its superpower. The whole world was united in the PUBG war against China supported North Korea. China knew that they are outnumbered and should look for some other ways. China, with its tech giant, launched COVID-2.0 PUBG edition. This virus spread mobile to mobile. World Gaming Organization declared this outbreak as a public gaming emergency of international concern.<br/><br/>Affected mobile phones flooded every service center. They were operating 24X7. Developers, software engineers, technical staff became lifesavers. The country opted defensive mode in its fight against COVID-2.0 PUBG edition. They banned PUBG until they made an antivirus. WGO ordered China to take down the virus, but it was too late. COVID-2.0 had corrupted all PUBG servers. With no options left, the United States got permission to destroy all PUBG servers, which marked the end of the PUBG war. The world lost its legendary gaming platform. I have seen PUBG fans crying. China and North Korea were held solely responsible for PUBG war damages and must pay heavy compensation.<br/><br/>CHAPTER 4 - HARSH TRUTH<br/><br/>BeMotivated network, without any further delay, reached Mehtab, who was devastated by the message. Mehtab knows what he has to do. He chose the other way, instead of living the remaining few days with PUBG and creating memories together, he decided to fight for the existence of PUBG. He has the greatest war to fight. He knows where to hit. He has enrolled in numerous cybersecurity online courses. He has never been that serious in life in recorded history. We all know life is the greatest teacher, and may this be the greatest lesson for Mehtab to learn in his life. Sometimes it is hard, but we have to face the truth. It is good that this truth has made Mehtab at-least serious towards his life, which indeed was important. The truth is future can't be changed. The truth is PUBG will vanish. By now, he must have felt the fear of separation, which is nothing but an illusion which blocks one's insight. Everything is connected; every emotion is connected; every energy is connected and can't be separated.<br/><br/>There is a line- "only know you love her when you let her go" in a song by Michael David Rosenberg. Truth has to be accepted, which are blocked by lies, the ones we tell ourselves. Everyone has his/her own time to learn. This is his time to learn. Love is important, but attachments are unhealthy. I hope Mehtab will understand this. I hope he will stop fighting for lies; stop fighting for the existence of PUBG, which is not in future. I hope he will focus on seizing the limited time that he has been blessed with PUBG. I pray for Mehtab; I pray for PUBG; I pray for their love, which is never-ending and everlasting.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Story of Racism, Elitism and Classism</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px"># I can't breadth<br/><br/>Motivation: <br/>The history here is to reveal that we should left the rat race and break the chain of racism, elitism and classism.<br/><br/>Recent Incident:<br/>George Floyd, an old black man lost his life when a white police man knelt on Floyd's neck for around nine minutes. He beg for his life and died repeatedly saying "I can't breadth".<br/><br/>What strikes the mind?<br/>Going down memory lane, I am forced to ponder on the famous words of the great human right activist, Martin Luther King Jr.; the need to throw more light on this saying has made it binding on me to elucidate explicitly the true intentions and sincere motives of the late icon when he said; “Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere”.<br/><br/>Looking at the world:<br/>USA:<br/>The incident of Racism and white supremacy against George Floyd. Blacks are treated differently in U.S.<br/>Europe:<br/>How Neo-Nazis were prosecuted on the basis of religion, minority and refugee status.<br/>China:<br/>The voice of Dr. Li Wenliang who pointed out Corona outbreak was suppressed. Now, finally she was diagnosed with covid19. The voice of dissent is also a form of discrimination.<br/>India:<br/>1. Caste: How Dalits and manual scavengers are treated by upper caste, although untouchability is prohibited by Indian constitution.<br/>2. Communal: How police treats the north eastern states people in case of a suspect.<br/>3. Regional: How south Indians are treated in U.P., Bihar. How poor class of U.P., Bihar are treated in Maharashtra.<br/><br/>#The battle to discrimination is way far.<br/>You must have remembered Nelson Mandela, M.K. Gandhi, Martin Luther King. The fights of these leaders are still not come to an end. Although much has been changed legally and constitutionally but the ground reality is still the same.<br/>The intention was not to deliberate and point out flaws in system but to show that only us, the citizen, the human can only change this.<br/><br/>#F4T<br/>If humans are treated this way, then how we treat animals? There are a number of incident showing man-animal conflict.<br/>Anything strikes in your mind? (Elephant in Kerala)<br/><br/>We must come together and spread this message in a positive tone.<br/>Remember: #Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere<br/><br/>The next victim can be you, who knows.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">My First Blog</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">First of all, I would like to tell you why I am here. In the world full of fake imaginations and envy, I am here to get some relief from the daily boring routine. It is enough to tell the reason of my such life is that I am an engineering student at IIT Delhi.<br/>Currently, I am at Jaipur, away from the daily world, and writing my first blog. It is not the first time when I am writing something. I used to write on Quora, but it used to be primarily on a particular topic.<br/>What should we write in our very first blog? A lot of people introduce themselves and discuss their daily life routine. Without trying anything different, let's begin.<br/>Hii everyone!!!👋<br/>I am Manoj😊 with roots at Kuchaman City, Rajasthan, in western India. I matriculated from ABN sr. Sec. School in 2015 and passed the 12th standard from Navjeevan sr. Sec. School Sikar in 2017. (PS: I am not going to talk about results in my blogs.) In 2018, I cleared JEE advanced and got admission in IIT Delhi with Computer Science and Engineering branch (one of the finest colleges with the delicate department.) With a passion for traveling in different places and making new friends, I am also interested in competitive coding and playing badminton. I am an active member of the NSS IIT Delhi and Indoor sports club IIT Delhi. Currently, I am in 2nd year of my graduation.<br/>This blog is as a dairy to me, and I think it will help to recall old times. I will share my life events and stories of my college life and the nostalgia of my school life. I will also share my experiences of IIT Delhi. In addition to this, if you find many articles on random topics, don't panic.😉<br/>Regards!</p>

<p style="font-size:20px">Dear Papa,<br/>Happy father's day papa,<br/>I wanted to talk to you. I mean, as I disappointed you many times in life, So I would like to say you a sorry, and all I want is just a hug for always being with me in every turn of my life. I understand that you have done a lot for me. This is not the single moment of my life, which reminds me of you. Our paths of career are different, but still, whenever I feel discouraged and sad, The only successful face that comes to my mind is you. You are my motivation. The amount of struggle you put for me, for our family is really appreciable. Thanks to this lockdown because of that I spent this much time with you. In Delhi, I missed talking to you, sitting with you. I know I have embarrassed you many times, I have not met your expectations many times, I have made you sad many times. But you always keep holding my hand. Thank you for converting me to be the person I am today.<br/>But I have a complaint about you. That's why I want to have a conversation with you. Why don't you talk? You never tell us anything. Who are you, how are you, the moments you enjoyed in your life, the struggles you faced, you never tell us. Your problems, your sorrows, your moments, your college life, you never tell us anything. You always keep asking us Kya kar rha hai, padhai kr le, ye kr le, wo kr le, aage kya krega etc. etc. Tell us something about yourself also. Today is 21st June, the longest day in the year, summer vacations, and most important father's day. Let's uniquely celebrate this day, just come and sit with us and tell us your stories. Let's build friendship, Papa.  I always wanted a friend like you.<br/><br/>Love you, Papa!!<br/><br/>- Aapka nalayak ladka</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Trusting People Too Easily</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">You are not alone in this strange world who is bearing a syndrome of trusting people so quickly. It is not much distinctive from Stockholm syndrome, except the fact that you don't have any opinion about the other person. It will be your first week in college, and you will meet someone. You will think you are 'vibing' with them because everyone else does too. <br/><br/>This situation occurs when You think You know them but actually, You don't. Sometimes, you just sit down and think, how can you be so stupid? And sometimes be like, dude!!, They are my friend and har ek friend kameena hota hai,  so you shouldn't behave like this.<br/>It can be that best friend who leaked all your secrets to someone else. It can be your friend who made fun of your weaknesses behind your back. The fact is that you were with them whenever they needed you, but there is no return policy. The point is, you trusted them enough to tell them things, which were your weakness, and this bit you in the back.<br/><br/>How did you even think for a moment that they were your friend and not machines or your personal diary whom you trusted blindly? And later, you will realize that "you judge people terribly". You can't do much in this situation except experiencing the harsh reality of this world. You opened the book of your life in front of them.<br/><br/>You think again and again about the mistake you made. You thought everyone has a good heart just because you have. Sooner or later, you will realize that you can't let others walk all over you. Listen to your dad when he says, "don't trust people too easily". You will start living your life with you. And that will be the moment when you will find a new way to live and enjoy your life without being anyone in your life. And maybe, then, everything will be alright.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Get into your deep thoughts</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Guys, we all know that it is one of the most terrible disaster happening to human civilisation. Although all of us are sacrificing and fighting with this virus, we do not know how many of us are going to win the battle and how many of us are going to fall behind.<br/>We are given enough time in this lockdown perhaps the longest time after we entered the college life, and perhaps is going to be our last such holiday. There are many unusual happenings going all around us. Though we always encourage to hope for a better tomorrow but no of is aware of what is going to happen tomorrow.<br/>Guys, stay at home and take all the necessary precautions. Take care of yourself and your family. Whenever you get time talk to you parents, tell them about your plans, talk to your brother/sister, spend some time interacting with them. We should utilise the resources we are provided with. I have seen people spending hours and hours on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, scrolling the posts/videos, but when they are asked for the assignments/online lecture, they simply raise their hands telling, "Sorry, I don't have an internet connection!". <br/>Stay at home, stay happy.</p>

You know i am talking about PRESSURE ON. MIND so i think somehow it's normal people scrolling post because somewhat it's help in getting fresh and at least we laugh. We already tired thinking about future, thinking about how would college do , are they going to take exam or not??. .<br/>.<br/>So i guess it's ok if people are happy by scrolling post, talking to somebody hours nd hours. <br/>So just be Happy that's the most important thing and #besafe</p>

I never dream of having a so good friend in my life, who is ready to help anytime, anywhere and for anything.<br/><br/>What I achieved here at college is "A few Friends",  ?? right a few!<br/>I have interacted with many, really a many but with only a few, I am able to make bond, a bond forever. I never dream of having a so close friend, so humble friend. He still have childhood left in him but that's truly a sign of purity, pure heart, pure smile and that's what I love the most in him.<br/>I always have a perception that the guys coming from hostels, big institutes are very clever and cannot be trusted soon (Manoj be like Papa ki sunkar aaya h shayad). All my opinions are vain when I met you.<br/><br/>I never thought I would write this so suddenly. When I was pressing b with my keyboard in a google search to search brusque meaning, google suggested beMotivated website (since I have history of searching) and in all haste, I pressed enter. I reached here, read some posts by Manoj and then my mind makes up soon to post something and I chose you, my friend.<br/>You really is a man with true motivation and that's what you did.(lol)</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Learn To Say No</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Yes!!<br/>Saying 'no' is not that bad. We have always been taught to help someone and not move back because they think you can help them, and that's the biggest compliment anyone can offer to you. We should always be grateful to them. I always obeyed this and kept saying 'yes'.<br/><br/>But excess of everything is terrible. Everything in excess is opposed to nature. You feel happy by seeing their grateful faces whenever you help them. But doesn't it mean that you are making them habituated to not work on their own? YES!! Sometimes it does.<br/><br/>The thing about being the person who can't say 'no' is that you are no longer doing someone a favor. They will push it on you like it's your job. And when you say 'no' the first time, you will suddenly feel like you become the bad guy. The fear of losing your friend will stick on your mind, and that will always force you to keep saying 'yes'.<br/><br/>Now I am learning to say 'no', and I am liking the person I am becoming. After this long vacation, I will be a different person whose 'nos' doesn't get stuck in his mouth. I am learning not to let people dominate over me. After this, I know people will be rude towards me; they will show that I am doing which I shouldn't do. But in 5-6 days, everything will be under control. I will begin to prioritize myself. After this, no one will be able to take control of my own. I will be the real 'ME'.<br/><br/>Say 'no' to the ones who are unkind, rude, and selfish. Say 'no' to those who are not grateful and trying to walk over you. If they text me that they "need to talk!". Bro!! I am not a therapist. Surely we will talk but not at the cost of my own mental health. I will be there for you only if when I know that you can be there for me, too.<br/><br/>This type of little changes will make your life your own. You will be able to enjoy your life in your way. You will find your true companions. And that will be the moment when you will realize the difference between fake and faithful friendship and also the bitter truth of life.<br/><br/>Manoj Kumar<br/>dayonhorizon.blogspot.com</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Dear Berlin From Money Heist</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Dear Berlin,<br/>In the beginning, I never thought of putting the "Dear" in front of your name. But you earned it by presenting yourself weaponless in front of the snipers.  <br/>I uncovered a lot of things from you. No other in-charge can substitute you in any heist. The way you tackled all the worse situations is much appreciable. I am in love with your leadership qualities. The moment when Tokyo played Russian Roulette, even your haters will appreciate your courage. Your dialogues, your way of saying, your leadership qualities and your friendship with the Professor stand outstanding.<br/><br/>"We are all going to die. And I drink to that because we are still alive, Here's to life." Your perspective towards your life is the one that should be everyone's perspective in a peaceful world. Even after knowing that you will be dead in the next 3 years, you went for the heist proves your own sentence to the Professor, "If a painter told you he had three years left to alive, would you tell him to stop painting." It shows your enchantment with your work.<br/>After all, love is a good reason to make everything go wrong. Why did you fall in love with her?? Why did you believe in her?? You were a complex character, yet you made us root for you when you said, "love can't be timed, it has to be lived." You loved and broke-up 5 times, and at the difficult times in the heist, you again let yourself find your 6th love Ariadana only to be betrayed by her.<br/>While you mesmerized us with your smile, the way of looking by your eyes and your wise words such as "First times are so special. Unique. But the last times are beyond comparison. They are priceless. But people don't normally know it's their last time".<br/><br/>You might be Andrés de Fonollosa, but to us, you will always be Berlin. You had spent all your life being a bit of a son of a bitch, but Yes, you died with dignity.<br/><br/>Love, <br/><br/>A Fan,<br/>Manoj<br/>dayonhorizon.blogspot.com</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">That Introvert Guy</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">College life begins. The very first day of college, shyness, and hesitation all around. He came in this world without watching all web series (Will this society accept him?). He listens to his friends discussing Game of Thrones, Friends, Money Heist, Big Bang theory, etc. etc. That's the time when the first stage of appearing FOMO. Bro! If you didn't watch Money Heist, you have seen nothing. He doesn't want to spend his 4 years of his college with this Fear of Missing Out. At this moment, an introvert person will always blame to being introverted. But soon, he realizes that it is not that bad. Even the fear of missing out departs from his life within 4-5 months. But he got to know the behavior of the world. An introvert person always thinks to be extrovert because he assumes that extrovert guys are the extraordinarily happy people on the earth.<br/><br/>You call him an introvert but, I call him a person with exceptional patience in listening to others like his own. He talks so little but so pure that you won't find anything concrete in that at first, but everything he says means a lot. Such a person has excellent observation skills. If he falls in love with you, he will use his observation skills on you. For him, observation is everything he listens to your words, watches your facial expressions, and talks to you only those things you like. Love for him is a responsibility. To fall in love with you is a gift he doesn't need, but he definitely desires. He falls for you for no reason, he likes you despite your faults. He leaves his comfort zone.<br/><br/>Shyness and introversion are two different things. Always keep in mind that an introvert person need not be necessarily shy. "I wanted to be someone else", often said by an introvert person. He always thinks it has to be cool to have that infectious energy that draws people around him. As a guy, he thinks this is the only way to get the ladies (although it isn't). Sometimes it's hard to explain to other people how it actually feels to be an introvert. For him, "Why don't you want to go to this party?" is sometimes difficult to answer. It's not like he doesn't enjoy having fun. He just wants to do it around the right people. He really does like other people; he is not anti-social. Be patient with him. After spending some time with him, you will find a trustworthy person with a deeper meaning and high introspectiveness who believes in "real" friendship.<br/><br/>-Manoj<br/>dayonhorizon.blogspot.com</p>

<h2 style="font-size:28px; color:#13E35E">Again an unexpected post</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">I wonder always when its time to make CV and I go back and think, what I have done so far?<br/>All i come up with is nothing.<br/>then i try try to recollect all my memories, I had spent in my college and an answer came that I have a few friends to hang with, and among those few, a very few is always enthusiastic. So, I must have done something for him?<br/>True, I found this network and then opened website and thought again to post something that wasn't expected out of me, but now that I did.<br/>We all have memories to think and wonder upon, some bitter, some sour and some sweet. In fresh time, all we remember and cherish upon what is sweet but we forget the contribution of bitter and sour memories from which we developed, we learnt, we acted and we won. Thanks to the almighty that what we are today is a better version of our one self.<br/>Once again think all over, cherish what you have and now standup and run again with a greater speed.<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/>-Aniket Jain</p>
